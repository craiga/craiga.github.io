title: A User Manual For Me
---

Inspired by [Cassie Robinson's article](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694),
here's a manual for working with me. It's very much a work in progress.

## Conditions I like to work in

- I like a quiet area with minimal interruptions.
- [Flow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>) is important to me.
  If required, I'll schedule my own flow time so I can get stuck in to my work.
- I like to have my own desk space with enough room for my 15" laptop and a 27" monitor side-by-side.
- I'm a bit claustrophobic. Having space is important to me.

## The times/hours I like to work

- I like to get started no later than 10:00 AM. This starting time can vary, depending on the situation. When working from home, this can be as early as 8:00 AM.
- I like to take a break somewhere between midday and 2:00 PM.
- I'll keep to my contracted hours.

## The best ways to communicate with me

- When I'm not in flow, I'm happy for you to interrupt me.
- I like to collaborate asynchronously (e.g. via a series of thoughtful Slack messages) or at a scheduled time.
- Slack is the best way to get my attention. I might not see and respond to your message immediately, but I will see it and respond when my flow allows.
- I'm not great at keeping track of emails—messages can easily get lost there.

## The ways I like to receive feedback

- I love receiving feedback! Even when it's not good.
- I appreciate honest, direct feedback.
- I prefer to have difficult conversations face-to-face.

## Things I need

- I'm a very social person. Spending time with my colleagues in a non-work environment is important to me.

## Things I struggle with

- I get meeting fatigue pretty easily. If a meeting runs for more than an hour, my attention will wane.

## Things I love

- Forming genuine relationships with my colleagues.

## Other things to know about me

- I'm a bit anxious and claustrophobic.
- I can be a bit particular about coffee, beer, and music.
